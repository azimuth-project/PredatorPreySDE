A stochastic differential equation is used as a model for predators and prey. It is a modification of a Lotka-Volterra model. It was used to make images for the blog post [This Week's Finds (Week 309)](http://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/02/17/this-weeks-finds-week-309/), which explains the model.
